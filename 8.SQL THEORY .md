# SQL Syntax

When performing operations on data within a database, it's essential to adhere to the predefined syntax of SQL.

- Keywords in SQL can be written in both uppercase and lowercase, although using uppercase enhances query readability.
- SQL statements are text-dependent, meaning they can be placed on one or multiple lines.
- Most database actions can be performed using SQL statements.
- SQL syntax is based on relational algebra and tuple relational calculus.

## SQL Statement

SQL statements inform the database about the operation to perform on structured data and the information to access from the database.

Example SQL statement:

SELECT "column_name" FROM "table_name";

# SELECT Statement

The `SELECT` statement in SQL is used to retrieve data from a database and display it as output to the database user.

## Syntax of SELECT Statement:

```sql
SELECT column_name1, column_name2, ..., column_nameN  
    [ FROM table_name ]  
    [ WHERE condition ]  
    [ ORDER BY order_column_name1 [ ASC | DESC ], ... ];

column_name1, column_name2, ..., column_nameN: Specifies the columns you want to retrieve data from.
FROM table_name: Specifies the table from which you want to retrieve data.
WHERE condition: Specifies the condition that must be met for the rows to be selected.
ORDER BY order_column_name1 [ ASC | DESC ]: Specifies the order in which the result set should be sorted.

Example of SELECT Statement:

SELECT Emp_ID, First_Name, Last_Name, Salary, City  
FROM Employee_details  
WHERE Salary = 100000  
ORDER BY Last_Name;

This example retrieves Emp_ID, First_Name, Last_Name, Salary, and City columns from the Employee_details table where the Salary is equal to 100000 and orders the result set by Last_Name.
# The SQL ORDER BY Clause

The SQL `ORDER BY` clause is utilized to sort data in either ascending or descending order, based on one or more columns. It is often used when you need to present data in a specific order.

## Important Points about ORDER BY Clause:

- Some databases sort query results in ascending order by default.
- To sort data in ascending order, use the keyword `ASC`.
- To sort data in descending order, use the keyword `DESC`.
- `ORDER BY` can sort data based on multiple columns, useful for hierarchical sorting.
- Besides sorting records in standard order (like alphabetical), it can sort based on custom conditions.

## Syntax:

SELECT column-list
FROM table_name
[ORDER BY column1, column2, .. columnN] [ASC | DESC];
column-list: List of columns to retrieve.
ASC or DESC: Specifies the sort order.
Note: Ensure that columns used for sorting are specified in the column-list.

Example:

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 ASC, column2 DESC;
# The FILTER Clause in SQL

The `FILTER` clause extends aggregate functions (such as `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc.) by allowing an additional `WHERE` clause. This clause filters the rows used to calculate the aggregate result.

## Syntax

The `FILTER` clause follows an aggregate function:

SUM(<expression>) FILTER(WHERE <condition>)
# Data Definition Language (DDL)

DDL (Data Definition Language) is used to define, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, and constraints.

## Example: CREATE TABLE Statement

The `CREATE TABLE` statement is used to create a new table in the database.


CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
users: Name of the table being created.
user_id: Column name with data type INT, set as the primary key.
username: Column name with data type VARCHAR(50), set as unique.
email: Column name with data type VARCHAR(100), set as not null.
created_at: Column name with data type TIMESTAMP, set with a default value of the current timestamp.
# Data Manipulation Language (DML)

DML (Data Manipulation Language) is a subset of operations used to insert, delete, and update data in a database. It represents a collection of programming languages explicitly used to make changes to the database.

## Overview

- DML comprises operations such as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to manage data.
- Popular DML commands include `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
- DML commands are often part of a more extensive database language, such as SQL (Structured Query Language).
- SQL provides specific commands like `CREATE`, `DROP`, and others for database operations.

## Classifications of DML

- **Procedural Programming**: Involves specifying the steps that the computer must take to perform a task. 
- **Non-Procedural (Declarative) Programming**: Focuses on what the computer should accomplish without specifying how to do it.

## Examples of DML Commands:

- **INSERT**: Adds new values to the database.
- **UPDATE**: Modifies existing data with more recent values.
- **DELETE**: Removes data from the database.

Database administration is crucial for managing databases effectively. Administrators monitor and maintain databases to ensure acceptable performance levels for queries executed by users.

# Data Query Language (DQL)

Data Query Language (DQL) is a sub-language of SQL (Structured Query Language) used for performing queries on data within schema objects. It is one of the base groupings of SQL sub-languages, which also include Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Control Language (DCL), and Data Manipulation Language (DML). Sometimes, Transaction Control Language (TCL) is also considered part of this set.

## Overview

- DQL statements are primarily used for retrieving data from database tables based on specified criteria.
- The primary command in DQL is the `SELECT` statement, which is used to retrieve data from one or more tables.
- While DQL statements are often considered part of DML, they are strictly speaking a separate category within SQL.

### SQL SELECT Statement

The SQL `SELECT` statement is the core component of DQL. It is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. Here's a basic syntax of the `SELECT` statement:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
column1, column2, ...: Columns to be retrieved from the table.
table_name: Name of the table from which data is to be retrieved.
condition: Optional condition to filter the rows returned.
When adding FROM or WHERE clauses to the SELECT statement, it is then considered part of the Data Manipulation Language (DML).

DQL plays a fundamental role in querying and retrieving data from databases, allowing users to interactively explore and analyze the stored data.

# SQL Constraints

Constraints in SQL are rules applied to the type of data stored in a table, specifying limits or conditions on the data.

The available constraints in SQL are:

1. **NOT NULL**: Specifies that a column cannot store NULL values. Any attempt to insert a NULL value into a NOT NULL column will result in an error.

2. **UNIQUE**: Ensures that all values in a column are unique. No two rows can have the same value in the specified column.

3. **PRIMARY KEY**: A primary key uniquely identifies each row in a table. It is a combination of NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints. A table can have only one primary key.

4. **FOREIGN KEY**: Identifies a field in one table that uniquely corresponds to the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between tables.

5. **CHECK**: Validates the values of a column to meet a specific condition. It ensures that the value stored in a column satisfies a defined condition.

6. **DEFAULT**: Specifies a default value for a column when no value is provided during insertion.

## How to Specify Constraints

Constraints can be specified at the time of creating the table using the `CREATE TABLE` statement. They can also be added after creating the table using the `ALTER TABLE` statement.

### Syntax for Creating Constraints with CREATE TABLE:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sample_table
(
    column1 data_type(size) constraint_name,
    column2 data_type(size) constraint_name,
    column3 data_type(size) constraint_name,
    ...
);
# SQL Aggregate Functions

An aggregate function in SQL returns a single value after performing a calculation on multiple values from a column. These functions are often used in conjunction with the `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses of the `SELECT` statement.

## Types of SQL Aggregate Functions:

1. **Count()**: Counts the number of rows in a result set or the number of non-null values in a column.
2. **Sum()**: Calculates the sum of values in a column.
3. **Avg()**: Calculates the average of values in a column.
4. **Min()**: Finds the minimum value in a column.
5. **Max()**: Finds the maximum value in a column.

## Column References

In SQL, aggregate functions are applied to specific columns referred to as column references. A column reference is the name of the column whose data you want to aggregate. To use an aggregate function with a column reference, specify the column's name within the function's parentheses.

For example, to find the average salary of employees in a table called "employees", you would use the `AVG` function with the column reference "salary" like this:

```sql
SELECT AVG(salary)
FROM employees;
# Views in SQL

Views are virtual tables derived from the results of a SQL query. They provide a way to simplify complex queries and can also enhance security by limiting access to the underlying tables.

## Creating a View

To create a view in SQL, you use the `CREATE VIEW` statement followed by the name of the view and the SQL query that defines the view's structure and data.

For example, to create a view named `high_salary_employees` that includes only employees with a salary greater than $50,000, you would use the following SQL query:

CREATE VIEW high_salary_employees AS 
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE salary > 50000;
This query creates a view called high_salary_employees by selecting all columns from the employees table where the salary is greater than $50,000.

Views provide a convenient way to work with complex data structures and simplify query operations in SQL.

# Stored Procedure and Function in SQL Server: An Overview

Stored procedures and functions are essential constructs in SQL Server for managing, optimizing performance, and enhancing security in database operations.

## Stored Procedures

Stored procedures are precompiled SQL code constructs stored inside the database server. They offer several advantages:

- **Database Management**: Stored procedures facilitate database management tasks by encapsulating complex logic and business rules within the database itself.
- **Performance Optimization**: By precompiling and storing execution plans, stored procedures can improve query performance and reduce overhead.
- **Security**: Stored procedures can enforce access controls and permissions, enhancing database security.

For more detailed information about stored procedures, refer to the article on [Different Types of Stored Procedures](link_to_article).

## Functions

Functions in SQL Server are reusable SQL procedures that take parameters as inputs, execute SQL commands, and return either a single value or a table. Key aspects of SQL functions include:

- **Reusability**: Functions can be invoked multiple times with different parameters, promoting code reuse and modularization.
- **Input-Output**: Functions accept parameters as inputs and return a single value or a table as output.
- **Limited Operations**: Functions are restricted in their operations and cannot modify database objects directly.
- **Scalability**: Functions can be scaled efficiently, making them suitable for a wide range of data manipulation tasks.

Understanding the differences between stored procedures and functions is crucial for efficient database development and management in SQL Server.

# Indexes in SQL

Indexes in SQL are specialized lookup tables used by the database search engine to accelerate data retrieval. They provide a quick way to identify rows with specific column values and significantly improve query performance.

## Purpose of Indexes

### 1. Improved Query Performance
Indexes accelerate query processing by reducing the amount of data the server needs to examine. They enable the database engine to quickly locate rows matching search criteria without performing full-table scans.

### 2. Efficient Data Access
Indexes provide rapid access to row data for SELECT statements, particularly in tables with a large number of rows. This enhances overall database performance by minimizing the time required for data retrieval operations.

### 3. Sorting and Grouping Speed
Indexes facilitate faster sorting and grouping operations by providing a pre-sorted version of the data. This is beneficial for queries involving ORDER BY and GROUP BY clauses, as the database engine can quickly access the sorted data.

### 4. Unique Constraints
Indexes can enforce uniqueness constraints on columns, ensuring that no two rows in a table have duplicate values in specified columns. This helps maintain data integrity and prevents data inconsistency issues.

### 5. Optimized Join Operations
In databases with multiple tables, indexes improve the speed of join operations by quickly locating the rows to be joined in each table. This reduces the processing time for join queries and enhances overall query performance.

## Considerations and Limitations

While indexes offer significant benefits for query performance, they also come with some limitations:

- **Overuse of Indexes**: While indexes speed up data retrieval, they can slow down data modification operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). Each index must be updated when data is modified, leading to increased overhead.
- **Storage Space**: Indexes consume additional disk space, as they store copies of indexed columns.
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Indexes require regular maintenance and may need to be rebuilt over time to ensure optimal performance. This adds overhead to database maintenance routines.

Overall, indexes play a crucial role in optimizing database performance, but they should be carefully designed and managed to balance performance improvements with associated overhead.

# Concurrency Control in DBMS

Concurrency control is a fundamental concept in database management systems (DBMS) that ensures the simultaneous execution or manipulation of data by multiple processes or users without resulting in data inconsistency. It deals with managing interleaved execution of more than one transaction.

## What is a Transaction?

A transaction is a collection of operations that performs a single logical function in a database application. Each transaction is a unit of both atomicity and consistency. Key points about transactions include:

- **Atomicity**: A transaction is indivisible and must be executed entirely or not at all. It either completes successfully, committing all its changes to the database, or fails, rolling back all its changes.
- **Consistency**: Transactions should not violate any database consistency constraints. If the database was consistent when a transaction started, it must remain consistent when the transaction successfully terminates.
- **Preserving Consistency**: While executing a transaction, temporary inconsistency may be allowed (e.g., during fund transfer). However, transactions must ensure that the database returns to a consistent state after completion.
- **Programmer's Responsibility**: It's the responsibility of the programmer to define transactions properly to preserve database consistency. Transactions should be composed of operations that maintain database integrity.

## Applications of Transactions

The concept of transactions is widely used in various database systems and applications. Initially used in financial applications, transactions are now employed in real-time applications in telecommunications and in managing long-duration activities such as product design or administrative workflows.

## Conclusion

Concurrency control and transactions are essential components of modern database systems, ensuring data integrity and consistency even in multi-user environments. Properly defining and managing transactions is crucial for maintaining database reliability and application correctness.

# Security in Databases

Security in databases is paramount to ensure the protection of sensitive information, prevent unauthorized access, and mitigate the risk of data breaches. Key aspects of database security include:

- **Access Control**: Controlling who can access the database and what actions they can perform. This involves granting appropriate privileges to users and roles and restricting access to sensitive data.

- **Data Encryption**: Encrypting sensitive data to protect it from unauthorized access, both at rest and in transit. Encryption ensures that even if data is compromised, it remains unreadable without the appropriate decryption keys.

- **Preventing Unauthorized Operations**: Implementing mechanisms to prevent unauthorized operations such as data modification, deletion, or insertion. This helps maintain data integrity and prevents malicious activities.

## Example: Granting Access in SQL

An example of access control in SQL involves granting SELECT privileges on a table to a specific user. For instance:

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON employees TO user1;
This statement grants the user named user1 the SELECT privilege on the employees table, allowing them to retrieve data from the table.

Conclusion
Database security is essential for protecting sensitive information and ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of data. By implementing access controls, encryption, and preventive measures, organizations can safeguard their databases against security threats and data breaches.
# Advanced SQL Features

Advanced SQL features include Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Window Functions, and Recursive Queries. These features enable users to perform more complex queries and manipulate data efficiently.

## Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Common Table Expressions (CTEs) are temporary result sets that can be referenced within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. They allow for the creation of complex queries by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.

Example of a CTE:

```sql
WITH Sales AS (
    SELECT ProductID, SUM(Quantity) AS TotalSales
    FROM OrderDetails
    GROUP BY ProductID
)
SELECT Products.ProductName, Sales.TotalSales
FROM Products
JOIN Sales ON Products.ProductID = Sales.ProductID;
In this example, the CTE named "Sales" calculates the total sales quantity for each product. This result set is then joined with the "Products" table to retrieve product names along with their total sales.

Window Functions
Window Functions perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row within a query result set. They allow for advanced analytical processing and are commonly used for tasks such as ranking, aggregation, and moving averages.

Example of a Window Function:

SELECT ProductID, OrderDate, Quantity,
       SUM(Quantity) OVER (PARTITION BY ProductID ORDER BY OrderDate) AS CumulativeQuantity
FROM OrderDetails;
In this example, the SUM() window function calculates the cumulative quantity of each product ordered, partitioned by ProductID and ordered by OrderDate.

Recursive Queries
Recursive Queries enable querying hierarchical data structures such as organizational charts, bill of materials, or social network graphs. They involve a query that references itself in order to retrieve hierarchical data.

Example of a Recursive Query:

WITH RecursiveCTE AS (
    SELECT EmployeeID, ManagerID
    FROM Employees
    WHERE EmployeeID = 1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.ManagerID
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN RecursiveCTE r ON e.ManagerID = r.EmployeeID
)
SELECT * FROM RecursiveCTE;
In this example, the Recursive Common Table Expression retrieves all employees in the hierarchical reporting structure starting from the employee with EmployeeID 1.

Conclusion
Understanding and mastering these advanced SQL features is essential for effectively managing and manipulating data in databases. They provide powerful tools for handling complex queries and analytical tasks, allowing users to extract valuable insights from their data.
